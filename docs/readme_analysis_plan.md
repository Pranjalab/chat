# Plan: Master the Source README

This plan demonstrates how to use Chet's advanced features to analyze and organize the [Moltbot Source README](file:///home/pranjal/Projects/chat/moltbot-src/README.md).

## 1. Discovery & Discussion
**Prompt Chet:**
> "Chet, read the source README in `moltbot-src/README.md` and tell me the top 5 technical concepts I should know."

**Goal:** Ingest the large documentation file and distill its essence without manual reading.

## 2. Targeted Extraction
**Prompt Chet:**
> "Search the source README for any mention of 'Brave Search' or 'Firecrawl' and summarize the setup steps for me."

**Goal:** Use Chet as a specialized search engine for your local documentation.

## 3. Organizing Learnings
**Prompt Chet:**
> "Create a new file in my admin folder called `src_shortcuts.md` and add a table of all the terminal commands listed in the source README."

**Goal:** Translate information from a large reference file into a personalized, handy cheat sheet.

## 4. Archiving Legacy Guides
**Prompt Chet:**
> "I notice we have an old `docs/legacy_setup.md`. Delete it please."

**Outcome:** Chet will move the file to `.bin/docs/legacy_setup.md` instead of deleting it permanently, keeping your workspace clean but safe.

## 5. External Context
**Prompt Chet:**
> "Scan the Mintlify docs link mentioned in the README and tell me if there are any new gateway settings for v2026."

**Goal:** Seamlessly bridge local documentation with live web resources.
